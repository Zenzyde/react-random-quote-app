## Random advice app using React JS  with Typescript!

This was a fun little project made as an entry-point for me to deepen my knowledge of Javascript and get my feet wet with Typescript and React JS, as well as frontend development in general.

It was originally meant to be an webapp that would fetch and display a random fact at the click of a button, but i couldn't find a good endpoint to meet those needs, so i settled for making it a webapp that fetches and displays a random piece of advice at the click of a button instead! (usefulness from any advice is not guaranteed)

The webapp itself can be found here: [Random advice](https://Zenzyde.github.io/react-random-quote-app)

# Known bugs:
* The button that triggers advice-fetching from the endpoint does not currently work on mobile
* Placement of certain UI elements are a bit off on mobile, haven't gotten around to fixing yet
